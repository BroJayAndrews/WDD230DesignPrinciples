            <p>Redit has a webpage that very clearly uses the prinicple of repetition. Their consistency with how
                they organize and present their articles provides organized flow through the articles. It also helps them
                keep you scrolling to the next article, which keeps you on their site.</p>

            <p>Even before I was studying web development, I always thought Xbox had a great looking site. In this
                screenshot we can see some great use of white space. The white space helps the whole page feel really
                clean and organized. It makes it feel like a modern website. </p>
